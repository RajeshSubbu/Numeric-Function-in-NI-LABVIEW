# Numeric-Function-in-NI-LABVIEW
Getting started with LABVIEW functions
ADD,SUB,MUL,DIV: 
             It performs the corresponding operations with two inputs and we can see the output in front panel by using indicator in block diagram panel     
INCREMENT,DECREMENT:
              It increments or decrements the value of input by 1.
ABSOLUTE:
       It gives the output only in positive value,eventhough the input is negative.
NEAREST INT VALUE:
       It rounds off the input value to the nearest integer.EG: 4.4 --> 4, 4.5 --> 5.
ARRAY ADD,MUL:
       It adds or multiplies the array of inputs and gives single output.
ROUND TOWARD -ve INFINITY,+ve INFINITY:
       Round towards positive infinity rounds of the decimal num to the next integer,whereas the Round toward negative infinity rounds of the decimal num to the previous integer.
COMPOUND ARRAY:
       It contains addition,multiplication,AND,OR,XOR functions.Array of input is given and it performs corresponding operations and the output is displayed in front panel by using indicator .
SCALE BY POWER OF 2:
       It has 2 inputs x and n.This performs the expression (x*2^n).
SQRT,SQR:
       It has 1 input,for which square root or square operation is performed.
NEGATE:
       It negates the value of input.EG: -4 --> 4.
RECIPROCAL:
       It reciprocates the input value.EG: 2--> 1/2 --> 0.5
SIGN:
       It gives 1 if the input is greater than 0, gives 0 if the input is 0,gives -1 if the input is less than 0.
RANDOM NUMBER:
       It produces any random decimal number from 0 to 1.
EXPRESSION NODE:
       Use the Expression Node to calculate expressions that contain a single variable. Input is the value that the Expression Node uses as the variable.Output returns the value of the calculation.
